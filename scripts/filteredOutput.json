The lengthwise cut helps to soak up the rich, Korean flavor–infused coffee marinade and serves to help grill it up quickly.

Noodles are economical to produce and could be dried and kept for long periods of time. The amount of rice used to make noodles was 50 per cent of what would be consumed if it was eaten unprocessed, so noodles essentially doubled Thailand’s rice stores. Colorful vegetables stir-fried with rice noodles and a lip-smacking sauce make this a delicious and easy alternative to take-out.

        "Smart Strategies to Lose Weight, One Meal at a Time Thursday, July 06, 2017 Share Tweet Email Pin Print Share Tweet Email Pin Print When it comes to losing weight, there’s no miracle recipe or magic food that melts fat. So, to reach and maintain a healthy weight, you have to change your daily habits…for life! It takes a little effort, time, and perseverance. Simply by moving a little more every day and by trying some of the meal ideas below, you may not only slim your waistline, but you’ll improve your health and daily vitality. Ideas to lighten up your meals",
        "Replace the ground beef in your spaghetti sauce with lentils. It’s a great trick to reduce fat content and calories, while increasing fibre, a natural appetite suppressant. On pizza and for other dishes using melted cheese, mix full-fat cheese with low-fat cheese, or mix it with firm shredded tofu instead. No one will be able to tell the difference! And to make the meal even more low-fat and nutritious, double the quantity of vegetables.",
        "Substitute pasta by using spaghetti squash, or “spiralize” vegetables such as zucchini or beets. A delicious and refreshing alternative! Do you like cream sauces, such as Alfredo pasta sauce? Try a 5% cream blend for cooking, or use soy plant-based cooking cream for a lower fat version. Replace quiches with omelettes and frittatas. Without crusts, these dishes contain less fat. Containing only 70 calories each, eggs are an excellent weight-loss ally. Two eggs make up a portion. Think about adding them to your salad meals. Note that a healthy adult can have seven eggs weekly.",
        "Add edamame beans to your menu more often. Rich in fibre and protein, they prolong the feeling of fullness, reducing cravings. Boil these frozen beans for four to five minutes and they are ready to be added to your salad meals, Asian dishes, soups, and pasta dishes. Nutritious snacks Since fruits and vegetables, as well as milk and milk-substitutes, are among the foods most under-consumed by Canadians,[1] make them a priority at snack-time. Containing twice as much protein as traditional yogurt, 0 or 2% fat Greek yogurt is a perfect snack. Ideally, choose the plain option and flavour it to taste with fruit and a drizzle of honey or maple syrup.",
        "Instead of a granola bar, muffin or other commercially prepared bakery product, choose ripe fresh fruit and a few nuts. A much more nourishing and filling combo. Low in calories, try raw vegetables more often. And for a dip, go with plain Greek yogurt with a little pesto. Snack on oven-baked edamame. A great alternative to chips! Need a more filling snack? Go for a hard-boiled egg and some raw vegetables, or make a homemade smoothie with milk or a soy beverage, fresh fruit, and Greek yogurt.",
        "No matter what or when you eat, it is important to respect your hunger signals and your satiety. Eat only when your body needs to fuel up. And remember that fruits and vegetables should be the focus of your meals. They are very nutritious, so they should make up half of your plate. Meat should be the side dish to your vegetables, not the other way around! This article has been sponsored by BOOST®, but all comments and opinions are my own.",

        "The NESCAFÉ Story Great coffee since 1938 Our coffee specialist, Max Morgenthaler, was on a mission to create a delicious cup of coffee simply by adding water. There was a growing surplus of coffee beans in Brazil as a result of the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Nestlé saw an opportunity to help preserve coffee supply. Max and his team worked hard to find a new way to make instant coffee that would retain the coffee’s original flavour. In 1938, they found the answer, and NESCAFÉ was born. The NESCAFÉ brand is born Named by using the first three letters in Nestlé and suffixing it with ‘café’, NESCAFÉ became the new name in coffee. Instant Success!",
        "Making coffee had never been this fast and easy. During WWII NESCAFÉ became a staple food ration for US forces. (Pictured) A Swiss newspaper advert highlights the speed and ease of making a NESCAFÉ. On Top of the World During their record-breaking expedition to Mount Everest in 1953, Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay, bring a trusty little tin of NESCAFÉ. The Founding Factory This factory in Orbe, Switzerland has been producing our products since we started it all back in 1938. Classy Glass In 1961, we launched our first glass jar, in Japan. It was a huge success and helped position NESCAFÉ as a premium product. Going for Gold",
        "We launched NESCAFÉ Gold, a classic premium blend, in Germany, France and the UK in the mid-1960’s. To the Moon and Back The first coffee to land on the moon. NESCAFÉ joined the crew of Apollo 11, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, in their pioneering mission in 1969. Developing Conscious Coffee In 2010, we started to focus on more sustainable development and created the NESCAFÉ Plan. It’s a way to help coffee farmers make a better living; support local communities; inspire the next generation of farmers; and do so without damaging our planet. Today",
        "The world’s favourite coffee. NESCAFÉ is enjoyed in over 180 countries. Our coffee is grown, made and packaged in a way that respects the environment and the people who farm our coffee beans."

        "NESCAFÉ Taster's Choice 100g jars, Classic and Decaf are not Kosher certified. For that reason, they do not have the Kosher certified symbol on the package. The reason they are no longer certified Kosher is because we switched manufacturing locations and the new location is not Kosher approved at this time.

The Quality Assurance team at our plant also makes sure that the fillers are functioning properly by checking the final weight of each of our canisters before they leave our manufacturing facilities. We recommend storing opened coffee in a cupboard, or pantry. It's best to store it in a cool dry place with the lid tightly closed. If the product is stored correctly, the contents should last from 4-6 weeks. It can be refrigerated however, freezing is not recommended. The shelf-life of Ice Java Cappuccino is 18 months.",

Our pods work with all Keurig machines. Comparing NESCAFÉ products There is! The main difference between NESCAFÉ Tasters Choice and NESCAFÉ Gold is the Microgrind process. That means we take Arabica beans and grind them 10 times finer than regular coffee. This process makes for a more full-bodied coffee experience.",
        "If you aren't a fan of the microgrind, we still have options that we think will suit your taste. We recommend trying NESCAFÉ Taster's Choice coffee because it doesn't have the grinds at the bottom and will be a lighter cup of coffee. The main difference is that NESCAFÉ Rich is spray dried coffee and NESCAFÉ Taster's Choice is freeze dried. This is the technical process that goes into producing the coffee and that is why the granules appear different.

NESCAFÉ Rich is a line-up of black and flavoured coffees. Both products are made at the same facility, so you can enjoy the same familiar taste whether you’ve purchased it in Canada or Italy! An important step in the NESCAFÉ process is drying the coffee. During this step we lock in the flavour ensuring it is perfectly preserved until it is ready to be consumed. There are two methods used to dry the coffee: spray drying and freeze drying. NESCAFÉ",
        "When we spray dry the coffee, we use heat to evaporate the water from the coffee. This is done very quickly in a tower by spraying the coffee into warm air. This results in coffee with a darker color and texture like NESCAFÉ Rich. We can also freeze dry the coffee. In this case we freeze the coffee, which separates water from the coffee solids and turns it into ice crystals that contain only pure water. We then carefully remove the ice crystals using a process called sublimation which turns them from a solid directly to a gas. This process is very gentle and preserves the finest quality of our premium coffees like NESCAFÉ Gold. Packaging",

        "Coffee Origins Where does coffee come from? At NESCAFÉ, we’ve put together this guide to help you learn about the different types of coffee beans, where they are grown, and the all-important roasting process. Coffee does not come from just one place. It’s grown in more than 50 countries across Africa, Latin America and Asia, known as “the coffee belt”. These areas have the right combination of altitude, soil and weather, providing the perfect climate for growing the most delicious beans. African coffee Thought to be some of the best in the world due to its wonderfully distinctive flavour, African coffee possesses the following characteristics: Syrupy Medium acidity Complex fruity notes",
        "Latin American coffee Universally enjoyed for its well-rounded taste, Latin American coffee makes up most of the blends found on supermarket shelves today. A few key characteristics are: Nutty Low acidity Fuller bodied Asian coffee Home to some of the most unique coffee blends with bold, unique flavourings unlike any other. Typically, you can expect Asian coffee to be: Earthy Gentle acidity Spicy Get to know your coffee beans",
        "It may surprise you to learn that coffee beans come from the fruit of the coffee plant (called “cherries”). The cherries are edible but taste absolutely nothing like coffee. In fact, they are mild and slightly sweet – a far cry from the rich and flavoursome coffee beans inside. There are over 120 varieties of coffee plants and each variety has its own distinct flavour. Most of the coffee we drink comes from either Arabica or Robusta coffee beans, or a blend of the two. Arabica coffee beans Known for its vibrant and complex flavours, Arabica is the most popular type of coffee bean because of its smooth and less acidic taste.",
        "There are two types of Arabica coffee bean, Typica and Bourbon. Typica (also known as Sumatra and Arabigo) is believed to be the first bean ever discovered (1,000 BC.). Bourbon is considered to be a natural mutation of Typica and offers a more balanced and slightly sweeter flavour. Robusta coffee beans Commonly grown in Africa and Indonesia, these beans have a higher caffeine content and offer a deeper and stronger taste than the Arabica variety. A popular choice for espressos due to the rich flavour and layer of crema it gives. It is also widely used in instant coffee. Why is coffee roasted?",
        "Coffee roasting is the process of heating the beans to bring out the rich and aromatic flavour that we know and love. A chemical change occurs giving them a deep brown colour with a wonderfully earthy smell. Before roasting, the beans are green and have a grassy smell. After roasting, coffee beans are ready to be ground and brewed. Light Roasts A light roast coffee is higher in acidity, low in bitterness and can also highlight fruitiness and floral notes. Medium Roasts Medium roast coffee has a stronger flavour, more body, less acidity and can be the most fruity and sweet among roast types. Dark Roasts",
        "Dark roast coffee is the most intense and bitter and is far less acidic than other roast types. It can have a smoky or chocolatey sweet taste too. Coffee Tasting Learn more Grown Respectfully Our Coffee Explore"

        "Coffee tasters use the Sensory Lexicon to describe subtle differences in coffee. Tasters can detect if the way the coffee was grown, milled and roasted has affected the final flavour. From the soil the tree was planted in, to the way it was watered, to the bag the beans were stored in, many factors can change flavour. How the pros taste coffee Professional tasters use a technique called “cupping” to identify the complex tastes and aromas in coffee. This includes: Le Nez du Café Aroma.

Häagen-Dazs ice cream is proudly crafted in Canada, using 100% Canadian-sourced dairy in all our products. We employ 700 people at our factory in London, Ontario, who are united by a shared passion for quality and a vision of excellence. Our Story Our values since 1960 Our values since The Häagen-Dazs® Way Ingredients Craft Local Moments Four Simple Ingredients Since day one, Häagen-Dazs has been committed to taking the purest, responsibly-sourced ingredients and transforming them into extraordinary ice cream experiences.",
        "Each Häagen-Dazs flavour starts with four simple ingredients – real cream, milk, eggs and sugar. To this, we add only the finest additional elements to bring each flavour to life in their own distinguishable way. We never use any artificial colours or flavours in our ice cream. Many of our iconic flavours, like Chocolate, Coffee, Strawberry and Vanilla, contain just five ingredients. Every bite is proof that when you start with something simple, extraordinary things can happen. Love for Local",
        "Häagen-Dazs prides itself in the global brand that we've become, but we are just as passionate about connecting with, and staying connected to our local roots. We believe that shared value starts at home. The closer we can get to those who embrace the Häagen–Dazs way, the better we can be for generations to come. Our love for local is reflected in our production too, as Häagen–Dazs ice cream is proudly crafted in Canada. We employ 700 Canadians in our Ontario factory, united by a shared passion and a vision of excellence. To top things off, we use 100% Canadian dairy in all of our ice cream. Artisanal Craft",
        "Creating extraordinary ice cream takes years of both practice and passion. For Häagen-Dazs, it's been sixty of these years, and counting. Our founder, Reuben Mattus founded Häagen-Dazs with a vision to create a new decadent ice cream experience. His devotion to quality has forever changed the way people think about it. Extraordinary ice cream, by Häagen-Dazs standards, is the perfect blend of unforgettable flavours and creamy textures. Iconic flavours that have stood the test of time, revolutionary flavours that offer a new sensory experience, and velvety, rich textures that make every bite irresistible. The only way to do this, is to craft artisanally. Exträaordinary Moments",
        "There's nothing we love more than creating that feeling of delight we all experience when enjoying a simple spoon of Häagen-Dazs. Every flavour is churned with that exact moment in mind – from the blissful satisfaction that accompanies each first bite, to the special moments shared with loved ones while enjoying Häagen-Dazs. Creating these extraordinary feelings and memories is our livelihood, and if we can do this successfully, then we've done our job. After all, half of our story is your story. Thät’s Dazs",
        "Since day one, we’ve strived to transform the highest quality, carefully-sourced ingredients into the creamiest textures and the most decadent flavours. Our founder, Reuben Mattus, was a firm believer in creating ice cream like no other. So that’s exactly what we did, and this is how it happened. But there’s more to our story. The Häagen-Dazs experience isn’t just about indulging in the most irresistible flavours. It’s about immersing yourself in the best moments that life has to offer. Large or small, shared or sole, there is something special to be found in every moment. And when you let yourself go and find yourself in one of these moments – Thät’s Dazs. 1960 Where it all started",
        "Reuben Mattus had a vision to change the world of ice cream. Using only the finest ingredients, his rich and velvety ice cream created an entirely new experience. With three simple flavours - Vanilla, Chocolate and Coffee - the Häagen-Dazs brand was born. 1966 The perfect strawberry Mattus set his sights on strawberry, and like the rest of his ingredients, tolerated zero compromise. After six years of searching for the perfect berry, it remains a fan favourite to this day. 1976 Brooklyn’s Brick and Mortar Reuben’s daughter opens the first Häagen-Dazs shop in Brooklyn Heights. It still stands to serve Brooklynites on Montague Street today. 1985 Crafting in Canada",
        "A state-of-the-art factory is opened in London, Ontario. Enabling Häagen-Dazs to be crafted on Canadian soil, by a team filled with passion. 1986 Raising the bar On Valentine’s Day, the bar was introduced. A whole new line to love. These Vanilla Milk bars combined the creamy vanilla ice cream that Häagen-Dazs fans have loved for years, with an irresistible milk chocolate coating. 1988 All new almond Two years after the introduction of bars, a new one arrived. Creamy vanilla ice cream teamed up with a crunchy almond coating, to deliver a new obsession to the Häagen-Dazs community. 1998 Exploration. Inspiration. Innovation.",
        "Seeking inspiration caused the brand to stumble upon Dulce de Leche in South America. The result, a taste that took you away, and a flavor that would become synonymous with the Häagen-Dazs brand name. 2008 Donation to pollination When bees were faced with an uphill battle, Häagen-Dazs had no choice but to help. To date, more than $1,000,000 has been donated to support the honey bees that support our ingredients. 2013 Getting in on Gelato Häagen-Dazs falls in love with the creamy texture of Gelato. Unable to resist, we brought our own Italian flair to the freezer. 2017 Our Spirit 2018 All flavour, no-dairy",

        "7 Cool Ways to Enjoy Hot Chocolate This Summer Wednesday, May 08, 2024 Share Tweet Email Pin Print Share Tweet Email Pin Print Hot chocolate isn't just for the chilly months! This summer, turn Carnation Hot Chocolate into a refreshing treat with our playful and delicious twists. If you are looking for a cool summer treat, these ideas are sure to be a hit with both kids and adults. 1. Frozen Hot Chocolate",
        "Not quite ice cream but frostier than a milkshake, frozen hot chocolate tastes like a lighter version of those summertime classics with a chocolate twist. Just whip Carnation Hot Chocolate, milk and ice together in a blender until smooth. If you're looking for extra chocolatey flavour, add chocolate milk instead of plain milk or water. Non-dairy alternatives also work just as well. 2. Iced Hot Chocolate Transform Carnation Hot Chocolate into a cool, creamy beverage. Simply make your hot chocolate as usual, let it cool slightly, and then pour over ice. Add a splash of milk or cream for extra richness. It's like your favourite chocolate milk but with the deep flavour of hot cocoa.",
        "3. Hot Chocolate Ice Pops Pour cooled Carnation Hot Chocolate into popsicle moulds, add a stick, and freeze. For a fun twist, layer with vanilla or strawberry yogurt for a Neapolitan effect. It's a perfect grab-and-go treat that will keep the kids cool and happy. 4. Hot Chocolate Affogato For a grown-up treat, place a scoop of Häagen-Dazs vanilla or chocolate ice cream in a bowl, and pour a shot of espresso mixed with a shot of cooled, concentrated Carnation Hot Chocolate over it. This twist on the classic affogato gives you the boldness of espresso coupled with the rich, comforting taste of chocolate, melting over the creamy ice cream for an indulgent, multi-textured dessert.",
        "5. Hot Chocolate Float Fill a tall glass halfway with chilled Carnation Hot Chocolate, then carefully add a scoop of Häagen-Dazs ice cream. As the ice cream melts, it creates a wonderfully creamy chocolate drink. Experiment with different ice cream flavours like coffee or salted caramel for a unique twist. 6. Sundae Toppings with Hot Chocolate Make a batch of Frozen Hot Chocolate and top it with traditional sundae toppings for a fun treat! Looking for topping ideas? Here are some we recommend. Mix and match and make it yours! ● Whipped cream: Homemade or from a can, it’s the perfect frozen hot chocolate topper. Say “when!”",
        "● A drizzle of your favourite NESQUIK® Syrup: Looking for maximum chocolate flavour? Reach for NESQUIK® Chocolate Syrup. Want a perfect balance of tart and sweet? NESQUIK® Strawberry is your go-to. ● Carnation Hot Chocolate powder: Sometimes a little extra goes a long way. ● Shaved chocolate: We recommend AERO or AERO mint! ● Topped with crushed mini KITKAT: Crush them in the package if you want a quick and easy cleanup. 8.
